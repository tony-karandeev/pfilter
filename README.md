Particle Filter algorithm implementation and testing

pfilter module
--------------
pfilter module gives universal Particle Filter implementation


robot module
--------------
robot module uses particle filter to localize robot named Paul 
in the maze. Paul is completely blind and the only thing he knows 
on each step is whether he ran into a wall or not. 
PFilter does not succeed in this example.
